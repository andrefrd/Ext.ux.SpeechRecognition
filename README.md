Ext.ux.SpeechRecognition
========================

An Ext JS 4 wrapper for the webkit Speech Recognition (speech-to-text) API

The SpeechRecognition class provides a handy wrapper to the (currently webkit only) implementation of the still-in-progress HTML5 specification for Speech Recognition. This class is currently only an API to webkit's implementation the Speech Recognition spec; the developer is responsible for interacting with the raised events to accomplish what they desire to do

A plugin for interacting with components will be coming in the future, although the extent of the currently supported events make integration with current components rather trivial.
